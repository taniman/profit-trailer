# How to run
Download the latest released jar file<br />
https://github.com/taniman/proxy-bot/releases <br />
<br />
Put the jar file in a directory <br />
Put application.properties in the same directory and fill in your apiKeys and secrets <br />
<br />
To be able to run the application you need Java 8 <br />
Open a terminal or command prompt and type <br />
java -jar ProxyBot.jar -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -Xmx256m -Xms256m<br />
On OSX or some linux versions you might need to sudo su and then run the java -jar command.<br />
<br />
If you did everything correctly the application will start without giving you any error messages.

### On windows
Open a web browser and go to <br />
http://localhost:8081/checkSetup/

### On a Linux VPS
curl http://localhost:8081/checkSetupLinux/ <br />
<br />
All rows should say 'Looking good!'<br />
If this is not the case, than you have an error in your application.properties <br />
So everything is up and running. <br />

# Running in the background
Use the provided pm2 json file.<br />
If you have pm2 installed just use this command.<br />
pm2 start pm2-ProxyBot.json <br />
pm2 save <br />
This will make sure that pm2 will automatically start the proxy when pm2 reloads. <br />
<br />
To see the proxy log you could do. <br />
pm2 log 'id' <-- this is the id pm2 gave your proxy
